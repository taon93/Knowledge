### Currently, I must focus on my week sides: inability to code and work with bigger projects, also train for an interview.
1) Interview preparation: working under stress and with limited time communicating during solving programming problems:
   - Codewars sparings with other people
   - Solving problems under the clock
   - Trying to record myself during solving problems, talking and explaining what I am doing. 
2) Debugging code: 
   - Learn how to properly debug
   - Learn how to utilise IDE tools for debugging
3) Problems with portfolio: 
   - Just do it!
