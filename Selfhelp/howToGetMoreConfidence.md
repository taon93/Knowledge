## Conscious conditioning:
Your believes and way you act in the word is affected and biased by rules, false axioms and misconceptions planted to your psyche by society and conditioning, they may be divided into: biases, ideology and judgements - they act as
a filter between you and reality. 
To get more confident overall, you must challenge yourself on a daily basis — try to do something — maybe small — which is hard for you, which requires courage from you. When approaching this task do it in the following steps:
1. Pause — zoom off, gain perspective — don't allow yourself to get in the current situation. Step back
2. Optional — get afraid — think about consequences of doing and NOT doing this task
3. Anchor — anchor yourself in current moment - focus on one positive thing that is happening at this moment: feel your breath, your body, warmth of the sun, breeze on your skin, music, pleasant scent, good vibes from the place etc. 
4. Objectify — understand that you are separate from your biases/misconceptions/judgements that produce fear and anxiety, they don't have a definitive rule over you and affect you only as much as you let them
5. Question — question and be aware of your thoughts: "Is this rational?", "Why I am feeling this way?", "Why I am thinking this way?", "What is this though?", "What is the origin of this though?", "Am I going to let these thoughts affect my actions?". You may journal through this process.
6. Reframe — Reframe your negative thoughts in positive ones ie: transform fear to interest or curiosity
7. Act — Just Act — don't get entangled with your thoughts — just like the cold shower immersion


Example — meeting with a girl that you think is outside your 'league':
1. Pause, refrain yourself from any train of thoughts that you usually have in this kind of situation. Try to step back, gain broader perspective.
2. Think about what will do at worst when you will approach this girl: She may laugh at you. She may think that you are awkward. You may don't know what to say,
then think about the worst things that may happen if you don't approach her: you will miss meeting potentially interesting person that you would like to have in life. You may become more and more socially awkward and solitary. In the end you may end up all alone, depressed and lonely. 
3. Anchor yourself in present moment ie: focus on your breath
4. Detach from your thoughts - understand that yourself as a being are separate from your thoughts, and they don't define you.
5. Think once again about your negative thoughts — assess them — Why you have them, what caused them? Are they true/relevant/rational/possible? What is origin of those thoughts? Are they related to your experience/upbringing/insecurities?
6. Gain genuine interest in this girl - who is she, what is her background, what she likes doing, why she is here at this moment, what's her story.
7. Act: approach the girl.
