### Proper balance of Active and Passive learning:
- you must divide your learning time for **passive**: learning from courses and books, and **active**: workshops and projects
- for me optimal at this moment would be ratio around 3 to 1 for active learning.
### Spacing
- it is beneficial to a space learning particular topic over a couple of sessions. Rehearsing after some time
### Explain concepts
- the best way to make sure that everything is clear for you and you don't have any gaps in understanding is try to explain subject  
that you are learning about. Thus, creating this repo :smirk:
### Keep tack of all your questions
- note all your questions, if applicable check them in code
### Rest and recover
- find time for proper recovery, get enough sleep and time to cope. 
- I have to limit time of learning/work to at most 10h
