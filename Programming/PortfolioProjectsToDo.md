## Minor Backend Projects - for learning purpose:
1) Web accessible API: communication over REST and GraphQL
2) Project with OAuth
3) Email service: send newsletter to subscribe users, contact form

## Good Project should have:
1) **MVC** - Model View Controller: Design pattern that organizes application, user sees view and uses controller,  
controller sends user input to the model, which in a turn process it and updates view accordingly.
2) **UI** - User Interface
3) **DB** - Utilises some database
4) **CRUD** - has implemented operations of **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete**
5) **Security** - has implemented sequirity, logging and encryption of vital information
6) **UT** - is covered by unit tests. The best way is to use TDD
7) **SRS** - **Software Requirements Specification**: specify business logic that should be covered by the project
   - Use cases
   - UML of dependencies
   - Architecture
8) Tasks divided to sprints, project divided into issues

## My projects that I want to do: 
1) KDM helper Android app:
   - Frontend & Backend: Kotlin
