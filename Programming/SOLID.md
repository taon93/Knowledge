### Single responsibility principle:
Class should have only one responsibility and change only from one purpose, methods should be compact and do only one thing
### Open closed principle: 
Class should be open to extension and closed to modifications, use private fields, use getters and setters only when you need
them, use abstract base classes, you should be able to extend class behaviour without modifing it. 
### Liskov substitution principle: 
Objects of the program should be replaceable with instances of their subclasses without altering the correctness of the programm:
Liskov substitution principle is broken when the class used breaks "Is a" test. 
### Interface segregation principle: 
There should be many client specific interfaces instead of one general purpose interface, you want keep your components 
focused and minimize dependencies between them
### Dependency inversion principle: 
Abstractions should not depend upon the details, details should depend upon the abstraction
