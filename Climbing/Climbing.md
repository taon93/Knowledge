## Main points of focus during climbing, skills to develop:
1. **Think when you climb: focus and work intellectually not by intuition.** 
   - Study holds: how they work and in which positions
   - Think why you fell off.
   - Think about positioning of your body within given move
2. Record your attempts and analyze them, keep a training journal
3. Improve your footwork by focusing on the point of contact
4. Analyze and practice your weaknesses
5. Visualise before an attempt, also visualise that you're strong enough for a given problem
6. Work more on projecting - if FLASH was unsuccessful by the long shot, try first to link all moves and sections
7. **Avoid Injuries - they are impeding your growth much more than suboptimal training session**
8. Keep your training focused and within optimal duration
