### OPTIMAL Theory:
The more focus we have on the task, the better, focus is divided on two main factors: Motivational and Attentional. 
#### Motivational factors: 
- Autonomy: How much control you feel over your actions
- Expectancies: How well you think you will perform on the given task
#### Attentional factors: 
- Internal Focus: body movement, body positioning
- External Focus: intended effect of the movement
